</p><p><b>否定转移的形式与用法</b>
</p><p><b>一、动词的否定转移</b>
</p><p>1.形式上否定主句的谓语，实际上是否定从句的谓语
</p><p>当动词"think"、"believe"、"suppose"、"imagine"、"expect"、"feel"的主语是第一人称，谓语动词为没有任何副词修饰的一般现在时，它们的否定式实际上是对宾语从句的否定。表示说话者提出一种委婉的看法或主张。如:
</p><p>I think that he will help us.--I don't think that he will help us. 我认为它不会帮助我们。
</p><p>I believe that he is right.--I don't believe that he is right. 我认为他不对。
</p><p>I suppose that he likes it.--I don't suppose that he likes it. 我想他不喜欢它。
</p><p>2. 形式上否定谓语动词，实际上否定复合宾语
</p><p>当动词"think"、"believe"、"suppose"、"imagine"、"expect"、"feel"、"find"的主语是第一人称、谓语动词为没有任何副词修饰的一般现在时，它们前面的否定式实际上是对复合宾语的否定。表示说话者所提出的一种委婉的看法或主张。如:
</p><p>I think math difficult. - I don't think math difficult. 我认为数学不难。
</p><p>I find the story interesting. - I don't find the story interesting. 我认为这个故事没有趣。
</p><p>I expect so. -I don't expect so. 我认为不会。
</p><p>注意:动词"think"、"believe"、"suppose"、"imagine"、"expect"、"feel"在下列情况下，否定不转移:
</p><p>(1)这些动词跟其他另一个动词一起做并列谓语时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>I believe and hope he won't do that. 我相信并且也希望他将不会那样做。
</p><p>I feel and admit that we are not foolish. 我觉得并且也承认我们并不愚蠢。
</p><p>(2)用于疑问句时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>Do you think it is not going to rain? 你认为天不会下雨吗?
</p><p>Don't you believe that he has done a good thing? 难道你不相信他做了一件好事?
</p><p>(3)用作插入语时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>Li Lei, I think, won't be angry with you. 我想李蕾不会生你的气。
</p><p>Tom, I suppose, won't be against it. 我猜想汤姆不会反对。
</p><p>Mike, I believe, hasn't seen the film. 我认为迈克没有看这场电影。
</p><p>(4)动词前有其他副词修饰时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>I really don't think it's necessary for us to go there now. 我的确不认为我们现在有必要去那儿。
</p><p>I feel strongly that he shouldn't do such a thing. 我强烈地认为他不应该做那样的事。
</p><p>(5)动词为非一般现在时或主语不是第一人称时，否定不转移。
</p><p>I thought that he wouldn't come back soon. 我原以为他不会回来得这么快。
</p><p>She didn't believe that he became a good boy. 她不相信它变成了一个好孩子。
</p><p>He thinks that he isn't fit for the job. 他认为他不适合这件工作。
</p><p>He doesn't believe that what we told him is true. 他不相信我们告诉他的事是真的。
</p><p>(6)当宾语从句中含的否定为"not……at all"、"not a little"、"not a few"、"not enough"、"can't help"等固定搭配时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>I think that he doesn't know it at all. 我想他对那一点也不知道。
</p><p>I suppose that it is not enough to remember the words if you want to learn the language well. 我认为如果你想把这门语言学好，那么只记单词是不够的。
</p><p>I believe that you can't help singing our national anthem when you win the first place in the Olympic Games. 我相信当你在奥运会上获得第一名时你会情不自禁地唱起国歌来。
</p><p>(7)当宾语从句中含"no"、"nothing"、"nobody"、"nowhere"、"hardly"、"seldom"、"little"、"few"等否定词或半否词时，否定不转移。如:
</p><p>I believe that nothing can make me give it up. 我想任何事情也不能使我放弃。
</p><p>I think that no one can escape if the ship sinks in the sea. 我认为如果这艘船沉入海底的话，那么谁也逃不掉。
</p><p>I suppose that he is a man of few words. 我猜想他是一个言语不多的人。
</p><p><b>二、状语的否定转移</b>
</p><p>有些句子形式上否定谓语动词，实际上是对句子后面状语进行否定。如:
</p><p>Let's not talk about it here. 我们别在这里谈吧。
</p><p>Don't read in the sun. 不要在阳光下看书。
</p><p>Don't talk with your mouth full of food. 不要口里含着食物说话。
