<p style="text-align:center"><b>形容词宾语</b>
</p><p>afraid, glad, sorry, sure, worth等形容词与系动词 be, seem等一起构成的系表结构后可以带一个宾语。现分叙如下:
</p><p>　　1. be afraid to do sth.表示“不敢干某事”, 而be afraid of sth. (doing sth.) 则表示“害怕 (干)某事”，如:
</p><p>　　She is afraid to go out alone at night. (她不敢夜晚独自出门.)
</p><p>　　Are you afraid of snakes? (你害怕蛇吗?)
</p><p>　　试比较下列两个句子:
</p><p>　　She was afraid to wake her husband.
</p><p>　　She was afraid of waking her husband.
</p><p>　　第一句意思是“她不敢吵醒她的丈夫.”怕她丈夫可能由此而生气。第二句的意思是“她怕吵醒了她的丈夫。”可能因为她丈夫生病了或需要睡眠。
</p><p>　　be afraid + that-clause表示一种委婉的客套话, that可以省略。如:
</p><p>　　I am afraid (that) I can’t go with you.
</p><p>　　2. be glad后可接of, 不定式或that-clause. 如:
</p><p>　　I am glad of your success.
</p><p>　　I am glad to meet you.
</p><p>　　I am glad that you have passed the examination.
</p><p>　　3. be sorry可接about或for, 也可按不定式或that-clause. 如:
</p><p>　　Aren't you sorry about (for) what you've done?
</p><p>　　I’m sorry for you.
</p><p>　　We're sorry to hear that.
</p><p>　　4. be sure可接of或about,也可接不定式或that-clause。如:
</p><p>　　We're sure of a warm welcome.
</p><p>　　I was not sure about two things — the grammar and some of the idioms.
</p><p>　　Are you sure that he is honest?
</p><p>　　5. worth, worth while和worthy
</p><p>　　be worth表示“价值”时, 可直接接名词。如:
</p><p>　　The used car is worth $300 at most.
</p><p>　　还可接动名词的一般式, 主语为动名词的逻辑宾语。如:
</p><p>　　This book is worth reading.
</p><p>　　在It is worth while这一结构中, it为形式主语,后面可用动名词, 也可用动词不定式:
</p><p>　　It is worth while visiting the place.
</p><p>　　It is worth while to visit the place. (= The place is worth visiting.)
</p><p>　　形容词worthy可作定语, 修饰名词。 如a worthy team 1eader. 它与of连用可作后置定语。如:
</p><p>　　an enemy worthy of his sword (剑); a cause worthy of support
</p><p>　　作表语时, of后可接名词。如:
</p><p>　　This place is worthy of a visit. 也可接动名词, 常用其被动式。如:
</p><p>　　This place is worthy of being visited. (=This place is worth visiting.)
</p><p>　　如不与of连用, 则可接动词不定式的被动式。如:
</p><p>　　This book is worthy to be read. ( = The book is worth reading.)
